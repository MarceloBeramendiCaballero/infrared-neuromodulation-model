 <h2>Description</h2>
 
Infrared neuromodulation is a promising technique that blocks action potentials by applying infrared light. It has two large advantages when compared to other neuromodulation techniques, which face two significant limitations. Firstly, there are spatial selectivity limitations, which refer to the region where the stimulus needs to be applied. For example, when using electrodes as the source of the stimulus, spatial selectivity is limited by the size of the electrode, which may be bigger than the region that needs to be targeted. Secondly, there are size selectivity limitations, which refer to the range of axon diameters that need to be targeted. Sometimes it is not necessary to target only a specific range of axon diameters, but pharmaceuticals and electrodes do not allow us to specify what size of axons we want to target.

One of the current problems when studying infrared inhibition is that before experiments are made, there is no way of knowing how much temperature change the nerve will experience under a particular laser average power. This can have undesired effects if, for example, the selected IR power is too high and kills the nerve. In order to address this problem, we developed a mathematical model capable of giving us a general idea of what the temperature change will be for any IR power before IR light is applied. This model serves as a great starting point for increasing size-selectivity during neuromodulation. Since axons with smaller diameters are inhibited at lower temperatures, being able to predict what the maximum temperature change will be allows us to choose what range of axon diameters we want to target.

To model temperature change, we derived its differential equation taking into account the main sources of energy transfer. IR light heats the nerve because energy is transferred via radiation, and the surrounding bath of water cools the nerve becuse energy is transferred from the nerve to the water via conduction. Cooling by radiation and convection were ignored, and the significance of this is discussed further in the presentation.

After solving the differential equation and fitting parameters to the data, we found that the model was able to provide valuable insights regarding infrared inhibition. The image below shows the curve fit compared to the experimental values.

After further studying the model, we found that it is able to give a good estimate of both the maximum temperature change that a given IR power will induce, and it can also tell how long it will take to reach a given temperature (for example, 70% of the maximum temperature change. These and several other results can also be found in the presentation!
